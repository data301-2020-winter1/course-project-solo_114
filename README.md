# Solo Group 114: American Medical Costs and Lifestyle

## ***Note: Analysis and EDA Contained within AnalysisMarkdown.md***

## Research Questions

1. What is the determining factor in medical costs? (Between Age, BMI, number of Children and whether or not the individual smokes)
2. What effect does smoking and age on Body Mass Index? Are either one the deciding factor in an individual's BMI?

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My topic is healthcare costs and general health of Americans, based on a small population set.

I am interested in identifying whether being a smoker, being defined as obese by the Body Mass Index or having children result in the most healthcare costs in the United states. I want to achieve this by searching for any relevant correlation between the ratio of multiple quantitative variables, specifically that of BMI, number of children being compared to the costs charged to the insurance while comparing these trends with the qualitative attribute of whether or not the beneficiary was a smoker.

I also wish to see how smoking relates to BMI within this small population set as I would assume they would be closely correlated, and I would also assume that if this was true then they should account for at least a significant amount of the health costs. 

Finally I would like to know what region of the United States has the highest BMI and smoking rates.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words


This is the dataset I want to use for my project, found in the examples described for Project Milestone One. It is a set of 1338 entries with 7 attributes, those being age, gender of the Insurance Contractor issued to each benefactor, BMI, Number of Children, whether they are a smoker, region of the United States and the sum total charged to the insurance from a small sample of US citizens, and is used in the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz as an example of data manipulation and according to the description on GitHub was obtained from Kaggle.

I can't seem to find the origin of this data set or the time period it was taken from, but the wide variety of attributes to compare still drew me to this data set the most.

This data set aims to explain the cost of a small sample of USA population Medical Insurance Cost based on some attributes, with some of these attributes being quantitative which can be easily analyzed alongside Insurance Costs as well as qualitative such as whether or not the insurance benefactor is a smoker.
